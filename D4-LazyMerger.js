// I want you to write a function which takes an array as a parameter.
//  That array will itself contain some number of arrays.
//  I want your function to return an object with one method, called next. 
//  Each time someone calls next, it should return the next element from the next array.
// If one array is exhausted you should skip over it to the next array.
