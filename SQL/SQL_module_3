Operators :

    <= : Less than or equal to
    >= : Greater than or equal to
    != OR <> : Not equal to

CONDITION KEYWORDS :

(for comparing conditions which have different boolean types)
    AND 
    OR
    IS NOT ===> IS NOT NULL (exp: when we have emails)


LOGICAL OPERATORS:
(these ones are using after WHERE , when we have condition and we want to add more information)
   
    LIKE : (use it for having a specific pattern)
    The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause 
    to search for a specified pattern in a column.

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;

    '_r%' : Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
    'a_%' : Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
    'a__%' : Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length

    IN :(use it for having different options)

    The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
    The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);


    IS :
    Special operator, very much like ‘equals’, 
    but is only used for values that potentially might be NULL.

ORDER BY keyword:
(comes after where if we have it)
    The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.  
    The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. 
    To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;




As Keyword :
    The AS command is used to rename a column or table with an alias.

    SELECT CustomerID AS ID
    FROM Customers;




SET FUNCTIONS: 

COUNT(), AVG(),MIN(), MAX(), and SUM().

when we use set functions we always should have GROUP BY and 
if we want to mention a condition instead of where we should use HAVING.

(in the question when we have by (something...) it means group it by (something...) )
