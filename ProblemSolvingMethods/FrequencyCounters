for avoid using nested loops and having O(N^2) time complexity

In This pattern we use objects to collect values/frequencies of values.
with this pattern we will have O(N) time complexity.

we can use two different for loops for objects :
( for..in and for..of ) :
 1) for...in :
  with for ... in , we check keys of objects
 example : 
 for(let key in object){

 }
2) for...of : 
  with for ... of ,we check value of each keys. 
example : 
for(let val of object){

}

==> Exceptions : 
arrays are one kind of objects. 
we can use for..in and for..of for arrays.
with for...in , it will show us the index of the arrays
with for ...of , it will show us those visible values.
