Selection sort is better than bubble sort.
in the selection sort , we are going through the array and we want to find the smallest value in the array.
we compare the first element with the element next to it,and we save the smaller one , after that we go to the next element and
compare that element with the value we have (as the smallest one),if the current value is smaller than what we had, we save that new one 
as the smaller one and we do this until we go to the last element,at the end we put our smallest value as the first element in the array we have.
