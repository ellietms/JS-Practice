Ask questions to make sure you understand the problem before you solve it
And also, while you’re solving too!
Like, if you start solving, and then realise “Oh, should it be case sensitive?“, ask!
(Another interview tip, as well as general problem solving tip: Break the problem into smaller problems)

One thing that’s common in interviews is to ask you to solve an exercise,
and then to either ask you to solve a slightly bigger exercise, 
to ask you to improve your solution in some way, 
or to ask you to talk about your solution

General solution - This is a thing you should always be thinking - 
what’s a general way to solve the problem, not just what’s the way to solve the example I was given.
(You need to fundamentally change your algorithm => You need to change what you’re doing.)
