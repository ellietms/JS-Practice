what are the differences between let, const and var?
var has a global scope and it can be re-declared and updated.
let has a block scope and it can Not re-declared but it can be updated.
const has a block scope and it can NOT re-declared or be updated.


When would each be appropriate too use?
Var :to use our variable globally and to have an access to our variable in the whole window and be able to re-declare and update it.
Let :to use our variable just inside of a specific block scope and do not want to have an access to it any where else and be able to just update it.
const:to use our variable just inside of a specific block scope and do not want to have an access to it any where else and do not want to be able to re-declare or update it.


What is hoisting?What does the word mean, and how does hoisting work in Javascript?
hoist itself means raise and hoisting in the javascript is a mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution



They are all hoisted to the top of their scope.
But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
