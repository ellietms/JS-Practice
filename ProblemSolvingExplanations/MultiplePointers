-- we learn it with the example of having an array ([1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4]) :

we have two pointers , one of them is steady until 
the second pointer's value is not equal to the value of first pointer.

when the second pointer value is not equal to the value of first pointer, 
we move the first pointer(add one to it), and set the value of first pointer to the value of current second pointer
after these changes we move on (for second pointer we always move it to the next element until we find the different value)

===========
example :

function countUniqueValues(array){
  if(array.length === 0) return 0;
  let index = 0;
  for(let secondIndex = 1 ; secondIndex <= array.length ; secondIndex++){
   if( array[index] !==  array[secondIndex]){
    index = index + 1;   
    array[index] = array[secondIndex];
   }
  }
  return index;
}
