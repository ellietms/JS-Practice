LOGICAL OPERATORS:
    LIKE :
    The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause 
    to search for a specified pattern in a column.

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;

    '_r%' : Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
    'a_%' : Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
    'a__%' : Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length

    IN :
    The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
    The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);


    IS :
    Special operator, very much like ‘equals’, 
    but is only used for values that potentially might be NULL.



As Keyword :
    The AS command is used to rename a column or table with an alias.

    SELECT CustomerID AS ID
    FROM Customers;


ORDER BY keyword:

    The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.  
    The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. 
    To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
