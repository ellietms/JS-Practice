Linked List consists of Nodes(collection of Nodes),
each node has a value and pointer to the next node.
and the last node has tail.
(like stiars)

each node just connected to the one node.
Do not have indexes.
(randome access is not allowed.)

the benefits of linked list is the insertion and deletion.
(for long data set)


class Node{
    constructor(value){
        this.val = value;
        this.next = null; 
    }
    push(newValue){
        if()
        new Node(newValue);
    }
}
