DISTINCT : 
It is the keyword, which means that in our query we are asking for a UNIQUE set of results
(we want non-repeating values)

WHERE :
WHERE clause describes the conditions to match for ROWS
comes after the FROM
contains Boolean expressions
Only ROWS that match a condition are selected

DATABASE NORMALISATION:
Organise a database into tables in such way that a table is created about one specific topic only.
1-To Eliminate the redundant or useless data
2-To Reduce the complexity of the data
3-To Ensure the relationship between tables as well as data in the tables

SQL CONSTRAINT TYPES :
Constraints are the rules that we can apply on the type of data in a table.
we can specify the limit on the type of data that can be stored in a particular column in a table.

SQL CONSTRAINT TYPES :
    UNIQUE :
    The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different

    PRIMARY KEY :
    ONLY ONE PRIMARY KEY IN A TABLE
    Must be NOT NULL(Inserting a NULL would raise an error!)
    Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
    A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, 
    this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).
    Can be defined in either a CREATE TABLE statement or an ALTER TABLE statement

    FOREIGN KEY :
    A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, 
    that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
    The table with the foreign key is called the child table,
    and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.

IMPORTANT : 
The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column,
because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.

    CHECK : 
    If you define a CHECK constraint on a column :
     it will allow only certain values for this column.
     it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.

    DEFAULT :
    The DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column.
    The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified.
