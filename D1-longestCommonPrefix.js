// Given an array of strings, find the longest common prefix of any two strings. 
// you would return "Hello "
//I'm asking you to find the start of the string which is the same for both strings.
//The common prefix of any two of [“Hello”, “Hi”, “Cheese”] is “H”
//The common prefix of every string of [“Hello”, “Hi”, “Cheese”] is the empty string,
//because they don’t all share one prefix 
//  how can you compare all of the elements to find the longest common prefix of any two?


// Steps : 
// try to write your function to print out the pairs
// after that :  instead of printing out the pairs, print out the common prefix of each pair
// Then instead of printing, make an array of them
// And then find the longest one


let example = [
    "Helloo Ellie",
    "I like cheese",
    "Helloo Daniel",
  ];
