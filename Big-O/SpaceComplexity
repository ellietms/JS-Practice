Space complexity (auxiliary space complexity): 

(space required by the algorithms not including space taken up by the inputs)


1.Most primitives (booleans,undefined,null,numbers) are constant Space.
2.strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length).
3.Reference types are generally O(n),where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys(for objects).
