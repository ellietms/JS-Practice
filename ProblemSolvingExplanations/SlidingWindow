this pattern is useful when we have (array or string),and we want : 
    1*to find the subset of that array or string.
    2*the subset is continuous in some way.


solving it:
we make a window which can either be an subArray or number or string from one position to another position.
and we move that window depending on the condition window either increase or closes(and a new window created)
it does not have to be sorted.
