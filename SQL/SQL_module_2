DDL : (data definition language) 
It is a subset of SQL statements that change the structure of the database schema.

SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index



UPDATE : 
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... (set new value for current column)
WHERE condition; ()

DELETE: 
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

ALTER TABLE:
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
        ALTER TABLE - ADD Column : 
            ALTER TABLE table_name
            ADD column_name datatype;

        ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMN :
            ALTER TABLE table_name
            DROP COLUMN column_name;

        ALTER TABLE - ALTER/MODIFY COLUMN:
            ALTER TABLE table_name
            ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype;


DISTINCT : 
It is the keyword, which means that in our query we are asking for a UNIQUE set of results
(we want non-repeating values)

WHERE :
WHERE clause describes the conditions to match for ROWS
comes after the FROM
contains Boolean expressions
Only ROWS that match a condition are selected

DATABASE NORMALISATION:
Organise a database into tables in such way that a table is created about one specific topic only.
1-To Eliminate the redundant or useless data
2-To Reduce the complexity of the data
3-To Ensure the relationship between tables as well as data in the tables

SQL CONSTRAINT TYPES :
Constraints are the rules that we can apply on the type of data in a table.
we can specify the limit on the type of data that can be stored in a particular column in a table.

SQL CONSTRAINT TYPES :
    UNIQUE :
    The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different

    PRIMARY KEY :
    ONLY ONE PRIMARY KEY IN A TABLE
    Must be NOT NULL(Inserting a NULL would raise an error!)
    Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
    A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, 
    this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).
    Can be defined in either a CREATE TABLE statement or an ALTER TABLE statement

    FOREIGN KEY :
    A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, 
    that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
    The table with the foreign key is called the child table,
    and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.

        IMPORTANT : 
        1-The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column,
        because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.

        2-A table may have more than one foreign key, 
        and each foreign key in the child table may refer to a different parent table.

        3-Foreign key reinforces relationships between t
        • One-to-one
        • One-to-many
        • Many-to-many


    CHECK : 
    If you define a CHECK constraint on a column :
     it will allow only certain values for this column.
     it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.


    DEFAULT :
    The DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column.
    The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified.
